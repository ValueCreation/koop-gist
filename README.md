# koop-gist

`koop-gist` is an input source provider for the [Koop](https://github.com/esri/koop) server. It can connect to GitHub repositories serving GeoJSON as well as Gists which are then output in other formats such as GeoServices (FeatureServices), CSV, KML, or Shapefile.


## To install

Source providers such as `koop-github` require that you first install koop:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Esri/koop.git
cd koop
npm install 
# copy and edit the config file
cp config/default.yml.example config/default.yml
```

you can then install `koop-github`. 

```bash
npm install https://github.com/chelm/koop-gist/tarball/master

# start the koop server
node server.js 
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can then visit Github repositories using the pattern:

`/gist/{gist id}/preview`

so for example:

`/gist/6178185/preview`
